#Netflix-landing-page

This project helped me get hands-on experience with frontend development fundamentals.
I focused on creating a clean and responsive layout, understanding how structure and styling work together to bring a webpage to life.
I used and learned the following technologies and concepts while developing this project:
1. HTML Concepts I Used:
   Semantic tags like <header>, <section>, <nav>, <footer> for structure.
   <figure> and <figcaption> for displaying visual content with descriptions.
   <details> and <summary> for interactive FAQ sections.
   Forms with <input> and <button> elements.
   Organized layout for sections like Hero, Trending, Reasons to Join, and FAQ.
2. CSS Concepts I Practiced:
   Flexbox and float layout techniques.
   Responsive design using media queries (@media).
   Background images and gradients.
   Box model, padding, and margin adjustments.
   Font styling and color combinations.
   Buttons, hover effects, and spacing for better user experience.
